 1. Formula for Calculation

We define the Civilizational Stability Index (CSI)  as the simple mean of all 14 coefficients:

\[
CSI = \frac{1}{14} \sum_{i=1}^{14} D_i
\]

where:  
\( D_i \) = normalized metric for category i (0–10 scale).  
 Normalization:  
 0 = total collapse.  
 5 = threshold of stability.  
 10 = optimal state.  

Rule: If any \( D_i < 3 \), it triggers *critical alarm  even if CSI > 5.  



 2. Description of Each Coefficient

D1. Demography → Fertility rate, migration balance, generational replacement.  
D2. Health → Chronic disease prevalence, access to healthcare.  
D3. Education → Competency levels vs. baseline (e.g. OECD PISA).  
D4. Ethics / Values → Indicators of family, empathy, solidarity.  
D5. Ecology → CO₂, biodiversity loss, planetary boundaries.  
D6. Economy → Wealth distribution, debt vs. real production.  
D7. Energy → EROI (Energy Return on Investment), sustainability.  
D8. Technology → Concentration of control, ethical integration.  
D9. Information → Share of knowledge vs. noise, algorithmic control.  
D10. Social Fabric → Trust, community resilience, family cohesion.  
D11. Psychology → Attention span, mental health, cognitive load.  
D12. Drugs / Pharma → Scale of narcotics, pharma dependency.  
D13. Politics / Power → Elite agenda vs. species-first ethics.  
D14. Historical Parallels → Collapse pattern similarity to past empires.  


3. Example Calculation (2025 data)

Given 2025 metrics (see `README.md` main article):  

\[
CSI_{2025} = \frac{\sum D_i}{14} = \frac{47.3}{14} \approx 3.4
\]

→ Below stability threshold (5.0), indicates systemic degradation.  


4. Verification Sources

UN, WHO, OECD, IPCC, Edelman Trust, Credit Suisse, MIT Media Lab, Microsoft Research, UNODC, WEF leaks, Tainter, Diamond.  

Each coefficient references at least one verifiable dataset or academic source.  


 5. Application

- CSI can be recalculated annually.  
- Critical indicators (D3, D4, D14) must be monitored monthly.  
- This methodology allows transparency and reproducibility for any researcher.
