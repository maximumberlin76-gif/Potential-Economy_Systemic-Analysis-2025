 1. Ethical Axiom
 Human ≠ resource.  
 Human = potential.  
 Children = the highest value of civilization.  
 Economy must be based on potentials, not resources.

 3. Main Findings

1. Resource Model → Entropy  
   Children, humans, and nature as resources → depletion.  
   Result: systemic collapse within ≤2 generations.  

2. Potential Model → Anti-entropy  
   Humans as potential bearers.  
   Children = highest constant of civilization.  
   Unlocking potentials creates new resources and resilience.  

3. Key Factor of Transition  
   Shift from “resource economy” → “potential economy.”  
   Otherwise: 2027–2032 → systemic collapse.

 5. Civilizational Quote

 A civilization that treats children as a resource condemns itself to extinction.  
A civilization that treats children as the highest value and potential — will flourish as a galactic garden. 🌱
